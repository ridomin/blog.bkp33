Hi, I'm Rido, a passionate software developer, self-taught on Microsoft development stack, from COM/VB to .NET/C#, and always learning JS. 

In love with Open Source, found Agile the *only* way to write high quality software.

Working in Microsoft Azure as a PM, trying to make the IoT developer experience better of what it is today.
